# Online_Store
This project is a responsive and interactive e-commerce product listing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features dynamic product cards, a real-time shopping cart with item quantity management, total price calculation, and deletion. Users can search for products using a text input or voice search powered by the Web Speech API. Smooth UI animations, such as product images flying into the cart, enhance user experience. The cart's state persists using localStorage, and a mock checkout process is included. This project demonstrates front-end skills in DOM manipulation, responsive design, user interactivity, and basic cart functionality without a backend.
